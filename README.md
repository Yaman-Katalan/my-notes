## what I've learned from today's lecture:
 - command Line Interface **(CLI)**: it's a text-based interface where users interact with the computer by typing commands. 

- Graphical User Interface **(GUI)**: This is a visual interface that allows users to interact with the computers using graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and windows. 

- Git **(VCS: version control system)**: It is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, keeping track of changes, and mergin modifications seamlessly. 

- GitHub: it is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds a web-based graphical interface, issue tracking, and other features to Git.

- Markdown language **(md)**: it's a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents. It has features like simplicity, readability, compatibility, common syntax elements.
